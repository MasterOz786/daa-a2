## 🥇 Problem A: Top k Gardens (Unsorted List)

### 📌 What's the Task?
PakFlora wants to award the top **k** gardens based on their scores. The gardens come in as an **unsorted list** of pairs:  
`(score, registration_id)`

We just need to return the **registration IDs** of the **top k** scoring gardens.

> ✅ Ties? Doesn’t matter — pick any.

### ⚙️ Steps to Solve
1. **Make a Max-Heap** from the list — this takes **O(n)** time.
2. **Pop top k** gardens from the heap — each pop is **O(log n)**, so total is **O(k log n)**.
3. Return the registration IDs from these popped entries.

### 🧠 Time Complexity
`O(n + k log n)`

## 🏆 Problem B: Gardens Above a Score x (Max-Heap)

### 📌 What's the Task?
Now the gardens are in a **Max-Heap**. We need to return all gardens with a score **strictly greater than x**.

### ⚙️ How to Do It?
- Start at the top (index 0).
- If the current score > x:
  - Save its ID.
  - Recursively check the left and right children.
- If score ≤ x: ❌ Skip the whole subtree.

### 🔣 Pseudocode
```
function gardensAboveX(heap, x, index = 0):
    if index >= heap.size:
        return []

    current = heap[index]
    if current.score <= x:
        return []  // Skip this branch

    result = [current.registration_id]
    left = 2 * index + 1
    right = 2 * index + 2

    return result + gardensAboveX(heap, x, left) + gardensAboveX(heap, x, right)
```

### 🧠 Time Complexity
`O(nₓ)` — where `nₓ` is the number of gardens with score > x.

## 🧾 Quick Notes

### ✅ Useful Tricks
- **Problem A:** Heap is fast for top-k.
- **Problem B:** Heap helps you skip bad branches quickly.

### ❗ Edge Cases
- If `k > total gardens`: just return all.
- If all scores ≤ x: return empty.
- Empty list? Still works — just return nothing.

🎉 That’s it! Keep it simple, use heaps, and let recursion do the heavy lifting.
